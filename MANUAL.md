# Introduction

The E2Everest project is a working proof-of-concept E2E-DTC 1.4 implementation that is compatible for use with the Physicians Data Collaborative network. The code here is  originally built for the OSCAR EMR, but the framework itself is designed to be as EMR agnostic as possible.

This Manual is aimed at developers, system engineers and integrators looking to add E2E-DTC support to their Electronic Medical Record system. Since the underlying MARC-HI Everest Framework models the complex Clinical Document Architecture used in E2E, using this framework reduces the amount of time and effort required in order to properly implement E2E.

Ultimately, the E2Everest framework is a great stepping stone for quickly implementing a compatible E2E document export. Using this framework can rapidly accelerate the user's understanding of the CDA model. In turn, users can then look to extend and implement other CDA based documents from this framework.
